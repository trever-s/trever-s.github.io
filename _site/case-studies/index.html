          <h2 class="header-subtle">Client Challenge</h2>
          <p>
          Users had to fill out a 5 page form. During which they had to create a login and remember it to get up-to-date progress on their drives' recovery. If they forgot that login, they had to call in for an update.</p>
          <p>Final payment was done over the phone. Each new recovery case averaged 14 phone calls from Seagate service representatives. This was a strenuous process that required a lot of personnel to support.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="large-4 medium-4 columns">
          <h2 class="header-subtle">Solution</h2>
          <p>Seagate SRS came to Iron-Point to turn this nightmare into a user experience dream. We worked with people around the global to implement a highly dynamic Salesforce integrated form.</p>
          <p>Our new form was a single page for submission, payment, and UPS label generation. The process takes less than 60 seconds to complete.</p>
          <p>In addition to that slick process, we also created a spew of Eloqua automated - multi-lingual - emails that notify users of where their hard drives is at in the recovery process.</p>

        <!-- Case Second -->
        <div class="large-6 medium-6 left columns">
          <p>Fluke's Thermal Imaging Department didn't have a firmware update process. Shoot, their products never required one in the past.
          </p><p>But something new was on the horizon. Fluke developed a firmware update to give their customers a chance to utilize the built-in wi-fi receiver on their device.</p>
          <p>With firmware updates at the ready, Fluke was prepared to give their customers a simple way to make the change. It was a task easier said than done.</p>
          <p>Upgrading a device in use around the world, and used for potentially nefarious activities, made for a complex situation made even more so with multiple products requiring different firmware updates, various countries embargoed, and some countries still pending legal agreement. Whew. And it all had to be communicated in 19 different languages to some 36 countries.</p>
          <p>We helped Fluke achieve their goals with:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Eloqua &ndash; Marketing Automation</strong>. Firmware software is extensive, expensive, and requires high up-keep. We helped Fluke identify a solution using their existing Eloqua system, saving thousands.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Landing Page</strong>. We developed a form that integrated with Fluke's existing desktop syncing software. We used this to grab vital firmware information that we used to process the firmware update and to predict the user's preferred language.</li>
            <li><strong>A dynamic thank you page</strong> which gave the unique code the customer needed to download the firmware update.</li>
            <li><strong>Responsive(mobile friendly), multi-lingual, email campaigns</strong> to alert the customer when the firmware update was available in their country.</li>
            <li><strong>A country approval portal</strong> built with Eloqua's API that enabled our client to easily add newly approved countries.</li>
