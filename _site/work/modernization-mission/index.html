          <figcaption class='case-figcaption'>The Hypotheses Workshop was a chance to share and validate our initial findings while nuturing early client confidence in our process.</figcaption>
          <p class="case-focus">Our hypothesis workshop revealed our client didn’t quite understand the end-to-end process a business goes through in their Network.</p>
          <p class="case-focus">When stakeholder research wrapped, I designed a co-creation journey mapping session for our end user interviews. The goal was to visualize their chronological movements through the Network. What worked well, what pain-points or unmet needs arose at each stage, and the tools or resources utilized.</p>
          <p class="case-focus case-rationale"><span class="case-rationale-title">Rationale</span>I chose this method because a participatory activity broke apart a two-hour interview, satisfied a sense of ownership for the interviewee, and reduced the download time on synthesis for my team. And more importantly, filled in knowledge gaps and assumptions we documented as missing during stakeholder research.</p>
          <img class="case-image" src='/assets/images/case-ocp-02.png' alt='The Game Floor'>
          <figcaption class='case-figcaption'>Inviting participants to our Mural board was a cinch. And it made synthesis that much easier for our remote team after interviews wrapped.</figcaption>
          <p class="case-focus">After 10 minutes of warm-up and opening questions, I invited the participant to a remote whiteboarding tool, Mural. There, I’d set up the scaffolding for a user journey and explained our intent and the desired outcome.</p>
          <p class="case-focus">While I conducted the session, several colleagues filled out the swim lanes on the journey map in real-time.</p>
          <p class="case-focus">These early takeaways later mushroomed into insights:</p>
          <ul class="case-focus-list">
            <li>The language our client used to describe the process contradicted the words we heard from participants</li>
            <li>The story of their time in the Network oft coincided with the maturation of their business</li>
            <li>We identified five milestones that drove Affiliates forward in their journey</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="case-focus">The final artifact also served as a historical record for our participants’ businesses, and we attached it in our follow-up thank-you email. </p>
          <blockquote>Trever has the unique ability to get people to share their true feelings or emotions with him — a skill that was apparent and beneficial during our Affiliate and Stakeholder interviews. He exudes a calm presence that instills confidence in his interviewees and teammates. He will continue to succeed in projects that allow him to lead the research phase, especially when there are interactions with users or client stakeholders.<span>&mdash; Christine, Senior IxD</span></blockquote>

          <p class="case-focus">I like to plunge stakeholders into research findings headfirst with role-playing. Skits, pitches, and in this case, board games. Reenactments give us the freedom to soak up other's experiences and suspend disbelief.</p>
          <p class="case-focus">How did we arrive at a board game for our final research share out? It began with rare insights:</p>
          <ul class="case-focus-list">
            <li>The journey isn’t linear. Affiliates moved through a series of circuitous routes fixated on a destination.</li>
            <li>Affiliates operate not like a persona, but a series of mindsets &mdash; fluid expectations, needs, and goals, shift through circumstance.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="case-focus">These insights went to the core of our gaming mechanics. My colleague and I began designing the game. We shot sketches and whiteboard drawings back and forth to each other via SMS.</p>

          <p class="case-focus">The spirit of our practice is to challenge assumptions and sacred cows.  My colleague and I received a lot of constructive skepticism before we presented our idea to our key stakeholders. When I walked our client through our findings on this project, we slowly led them to our conclusion, pacing them throughout the thought process.</p>
          <blockquote>The most noteworthy example of Trever challenging ‘status quo’ thinking was through the Affiliate journey map. Trever strongly advocated for a different approach (a board game, which better-reflected customer mindsets and day-to-day experiences), which was met with pockets of skepticism, initially including my own. Through team conversations, Trever refined his vision and helped us deliver the board game that was unquestionably the home run of the final workshop and perhaps the program.<span>&mdash; Dave, Client Account Lead</span></blockquote>
          <p class="case-focus">One month after the initial project ended, we were back at it again, presenting the board game to our client’s leadership team at one of their more significant events. It was such a hit, the board game, and all sixteen gaming sets began to make the rounds on their campus. Before departing Fjord, client requests continued to come in to ‘play the game.’ </p>
          <blockquote>After 11 years at this company, I can honestly say this was by far the most informative and fun activity I’ve been through.<span>&mdash; Client Participant</span></blockquote>
          <p class="case-focus">The board game wasn’t just a game; it was an empathy-building activity. When you play the game, you feel the same stressors that we observed in our research. Getting people in this headspace was the perfect way to catapult them toward convergent thinking and concept development.</p>
          <blockquote>The current state research and empathy-building (board game) activity was so great that I want to bring you back in to do that for my boss’s cohorts.<span>&mdash; Client Participant</span></blockquote>

          <p class="case-focus">Over ten weeks, myself and six other colleagues partnered with our client to conduct in-depth interviews, a comparative and competitive audit, and facilitated co-creation workshops.</p>
          <p class="case-focus">Our research aimed to uncover customer mindsets based on pain-points, needs, and motivations. We surfaced opportunity areas across the Affiliate Journey that informed our final concepts and release roadmap.</p>
          <img class="case-image" src='/assets/images/case-ocp-07.png' alt='Anatomy of the final presenation'><figcaption class='case-figcaption'>The final deliverable contained seven concepts mapped against a release roadmap.</figcaption>
          <p class="case-focus">I was responsible for creating the final presentation deck and worked alongside a Senior Visual Designer and Design Director. I wrote the majority of the content for the seven concepts and worked closely with our Technologist to finish the roadmap.</p>
          <blockquote>Trever’s contribution to the team was immeasurable. He was my personal go-to for any questions I had or input I needed to move forward. He took on a great deal of ownership of the final deliverables, providing content, useful visual direction, and stellar copy. In addition to being highly professional, reliable, available, and communicative, Trever is just an incredibly pleasant person to work with. He has a calm, confident demeanor and an easy-going personality, handling challenges with humor and tact. I’d welcome the opportunity to work with him again.<span>&mdash; Ki, Senior Visual Designer</span></blockquote>
          <blockquote>Trever exhibited transitional leadership on this program when two new team members came on board in the final three weeks of the program, while concurrently, two other team members left the team. Trever was the glue that held the two ‘phases’ of the project together, and without him, I do not believe we would have had such a successful (and stress-free!) end to the program. I observed Trever taking time out of his busy schedule to work with his teammates, to ensure that they were looped into conversations that may have been held without them (we had remote team members) and that they were clear on the next steps forward. This skill will serve Trever well as he continues to take on leadership roles in future programs. This team trusts and respects Trever — something that cannot be understated in a team lead.<span>&mdash; Maria, Project Manager</span></blockquote>
