          <!-- Challenge -->
          <p class="case-focus">My team's first research goal? Become fluent in our client's domain to earn their trust. We used a mix of desk research, interviews, and a hypothesis workshop. During the background period we asked, “how would you describe your Affiliate's end-to-end experience in the Affiliate Network?” The outputs were many: proto-personas, rough journey maps, and a stack of research questions for our team to pursue. We now asked, "how might we explore the client's current knowledge of customers using in-depth interviews?" We chose this approach because the client's previous body of research, survey feedback, answered the "how" but not so much the "why" behind customer behaviors we had questions about.</p>
          <h2 class="case-title">Solution</h2>
          <!-- Solution -->
          <p class="case-focus">To bridge the gap, I proposed an update to our research plan. Like the journey maps our client created, we orchestrated a co-creation exercise for Affiliates to break up two-hour interviews. My team agreed that this methodology would allow us to test several of our working hypotheses.</p>

Sometimes they got stuck on &ldquo;dirt roads&rdquo;, other times they cruised along &ldquo;the highway.&rdquo; But what were the mitigating forces, and what kinds of mindsets were a factor in this environment? The puzzle came together on our affinity board by grouping customer's pain-points.</li>
            <li><span class="peach">&#10124;</span> Affiliates were affected by conditions out of their control, but caused by our client unintentionally. Managers had higher priorities, so theirs took a back seat. Sales tools had bugs, causing leads to vanish. Weeks passed without a phone call returned. Uncertainty got in the way of aspirations. Affiliates were at the mercy of the client. As one Affiliate put it, "We are a krill swimming beside a huge whale. If they move just a little bit, they crush us."</li>

          <!-- Challenge -->
          <p class="case-focus">
          Here's the messy the part (you gotta have a messy part, right?). We tried to shoehorn our interview synthesis board into a journey map-esque spreadsheet. Helpful for identifying milestones. Not helpful if the route Affiliates take to get to the milestones looks like a roller coaster. What we learned about Affiliates required pause for an alternative deliverable. Not a journey map, like the one engraved in the statement of work. No. Something like a board game that forced players to experience the frustrations voiced by Affiliates.</p>
          <p class="case-focus">Our internal leadership balked at the pitch. But often the spirit of research is to welcome the occasional raised eyebrow. It means you're on to something. With constructive dialog we found a compromise together. By walking the client through our findings, they would need to arrive at a similar conclusion. The client’s exact words were, “this could be a game.” We had one week to prepare a finished product.</p>

          <p class="case-focus">
             Our recommendations increased self-governance for Affiliates.  Several concepts have since gone into v1 and v2 production. First quarter reports showed a 29% increase in customer engagement.

          <p class="case-focus">One month later, we were back at it, presenting the board game to our client’s greater leadership team. Requests to “play the game” continued to roll in before I left Fjord.</p>

<!--           <h2 class="case-title">Reflection</h2>
          <p class="case-focus">Our research plan is a guide, never a rulebook. Nascent observations, if we’re paying attention, demand a new direction. I’m proud of this work, both parties displayed a willingness to pursue uncomfortable truths for the sake of the customer’s well-being. Research that travels far must come from a place of collective ownership within an organization.</p> -->
