            Imagine a SaaS product that lets you develop your business on the backbone of one of the largest technology companies in the world. One day, your assigned manager can no longer help you expand your business. Life changed for 50,000 Affiliates in the network. The replacement? A self-service portal with a suite of marketing and sales tools. Affiliates were not happy. The survey data that raised this portal wasn’t robust enough to tell our client why it was failing. Fjord was hired to round out this quantitative puzzle. We conducted in-depth stakeholder, customer, and desk research, collaborated with the client at each turn, and delivered self-service concepts.

          <p class="case-focus">Our team had built a cumulative knowledge of the Affiliate Network. We didn’t know we were about to unearth our insight: circuitous routes. "A what?" Affiliates, no surprise, shirked convention. They did the opposite of traveling in a linear pathway, moving along the journey backward, forward, even loop-the-loops. This discovery jolted the client’s understanding of their Affiliates, paving the way for an unusual deliverable. </p>

          <!-- Challenge -->
          <p class="case-focus">When we mapped out the affiliate journey, we realized it had to be from the customer’s perspective. It needed to draw into account 1500 surveys, 12 in-depth interviews, 12 co-created journey maps, and 12 in-depths stakeholder interviews.</p>
          <p class="case-focus">To show Affiliates' unique experiences, we proposed a journey map turned interactive board game. Leadership balked. But often the spirit of research is to challenge sacred cows. With constructive dialog, we found a compromise: walk the client through our findings, if they arrive at the same conclusions we did — green light. The client’s exact words were, “this could be a game.” We had one week to develop a finished product.</p>
          <h2 class="case-title">Solution</h2>
          <!-- Solution -->
          <p class="case-focus">I’ve struggled in the past with behemoth synthesis sessions. This time I championed just-in-time synthesis, a mini daily rolling debrief which sped up the means to compile quotes on the board game. More push back meant we redoubled our effort, holding a working prototype session early. Through iterative game play with studio mates, we laughed and riffed until the game was ready to hit the printing press.</p>

Prioritized twelve winners. Over two weeks, my team worked with the client to bring those ideas into their finished form. Our efforts resulted in a final deliverable, a toothsome slide deck full of concept storyboards.</p>
          <!-- Reflection -->
          <h2 class="case-title">Reflection</h2>
          <p class="case-focus">The client felt suspicious. Their “organization held apprehensions of outside research” that upended their beliefs. It was awesome that we had developed a rapid candor with their team. With a time machine, I would have reached back and walked them through how we landed on our conclusions, leveraging their data (not just ours). Our desk research was meticulous. The team reviewed white papers while talking to the researchers who wrote the darned reports. Our analysis touched on at least two data points (let’s not get carried away). This grounded our evidence in convergent validity.</p>

          <h2 class="case-title">Final deliverable challenge</h2>
          <!-- Challenge -->
          <p class="case-focus">Two new team members came aboard in the final three weeks of the program. Three other members left the team. I was the sole living embodiment of the entire program. Along with my Project Manager. Whom was on vacation. Did I mention our principal client contact was leaving the company?  The spotlight was chasing me. I stepped in to become the teams interim design lead. It was easy. I worked with amazing professionals.</p>
          <h2 class="case-title">Solution</h2>
          <!-- Solution -->
          <p class="case-focus">At Fjord, even in the fuzzy front-end, we try to communicate design’s purpose to the client. It’s occasionally a dog and pony show, sure. There’s a genuine enthusiasm to show we love our work. This stokes the collaborative fires. Stepping into a transitional leadership role, I took those same ethos to heart.</p>
          <p class="case-focus">Is a designer a copywriter? The concept storyboards weren’t going to write themselves. We turned sketched concepts into polished storyboards. Along with concepts, we told the story of how we reached our recommendations. With solid research, heavy client participation, and a product roadmap. We did one better. We provided both a long-term and short-term vision, detailing its impact to our client.</p>
          <p class="case-focus">The hand-off document is akin to slipping a message in a bottle into the open sea. You have no idea who will open it. You want the reader to see they’ve stumbled upon a message written just for them. The letter should steer confidence in the reader. It will show that you considered their business from the inside out, examined their organizational capabilities, and became intimate with their customer’s unmet needs. That’s what we achieved in the final act of this work.</p>

          <!-- Outcome -->
          <h2 class="case-title">Outcome</h2>
          <p class="case-focus">
             Several concepts have gone into production. First quarter reports showed a 29% increase in Affiliate engagement. Our recommendations laid the groundwork. The client is adopting new modes of listening and learning from their customer. We instilled the confidence required to make more effective future improvements to their Affiliate network.

          <!-- Next Steps -->
          <h2 class="case-title">Next steps</h2>
          <p class="case-focus">One month later, we were back at it, presenting the board game to our client’s leadership team. Requests to “play the game” continued to roll in.</p>
          <!-- Reflection -->
          <h2 class="case-title">Reflection</h2>
          <p class="case-focus">Our research plan is a guide, never a rulebook. Nascent observations, if we’re paying attention, demand a new direction. I’m proud of this work, both parties displayed a willingness to pursue uncomfortable truths for the sake of the customer’s well-being. Research that travels far must come from a place of collective ownership within an organization.</p>
