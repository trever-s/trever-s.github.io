    <p class="heading-callout">
      Following strict international security laws, Fluke needed a cost effective way to activate firmware updates for their thermal imager product line.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Process -->
<div class="row">
  <div class="medium-8 medium-centered large-6 columns">
    <h1 class="heading">Process</h1>
    <p>Two deliverables needed to be created for this project:</p>
    <p>1) An internal website the Fluke team could use to initiate firmware updates for separate countries as gradually approved by different country's international laws.</p>
    <p>We discussed the purpose of the website through several interviews with stakeholders responsible for managing the team who would use the site. The feedback we received was mostly positive, but there was a lot of confusion based around the language in the user interface. To correct this issue we simplified the language in use as to make it hard to misinterpret and tested it on a group of half-dozen Fluke employees.</p>
    <p>We then took our research and proposed a design with an interactive prototype demonstrating the task flow from A to Z.</p>

    <p>2) An international email, informing customers in over 21 different languages that a firmware update was available for their device. This email needed to be straightforward and include three-step instructions as well as work on mobile devices. It would be sent out once a country was approved in the portal.</p>
    <p>To ensure ease-of-use we researched the feasibility of our proposed email layout in several different languages, including those that read right-to-left like Arabic as well as those which contained extremely long words, like German and Finnish.</p>

<!-- Hiccups -->
<div class="row bump-90">
  <div class="medium-8 medium-centered large-6 columns">
    <h1 class="heading">Hiccups</h1>
    <p>We found out that only one user could be logged in to the website portal at any given time to prevent overlap in the firmware update settings. To fix this we developed a pop-up screen when informing the potential user which employee was currently logged in to the portal.</p>
    <p>Our visual designer was on vacation at Burning Man so I was unexpectedly placed as the design lead for this project. I chose a fairly utilitarian layout for the sake of making the firmware upgrade instructions easy to act on.</p>

<!-- Results -->
<div class="row bump-90">
  <div class="medium-8 medium-centered large-6 columns">
    <h1 class="heading">Results</h1>
    <p>1) Portal: We were able to meet the needs of the management team and developed a flow which met their business needs.</p>
    <p>2) Email: We used fluid layouts were language would extended past the column width for desktop and mobile devices to combat longer foreign words. We then used a simple pictographic step sequence using technology all users who owned the device would find familiar.</p>
    <p>Both products released in concert were a success. Within the first quarter almost 75% of firmware updates had been issued to international customers, with a 92% firmware update completion report, saving Fluke a substantial amount of overhead.</p>

    <p>Fluke had completed their first round of firmware updates using our technology and has since come back from a second update using new emails and updates to the portal.</p>
