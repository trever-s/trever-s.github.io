<!-- Backstory -->

    <h1 class="heading">Backstory</h1>
    <p>This was a six month project with a sizable budget. A good chunk of that invested in API integrations. Our client's new business model revisited their customer relationships. This time user experience was a top priority. We called the shots from the the first meeting and had their full support.</p>
    <p>With the client behind us we conducted extensive discovery, research and design. The culmination of our efforts resulted in two final products.</p>

        <p>Before moving on to interviews and surveys we used secondary data to help fill in knowledge gaps.</p>
        <p>The analytics showed a dramatic bounce rate generally idicative of a major flaw on the form. Our heuristic markup exercise later revealed this to be a technical issue.</p>
        <p>We also watched prerecorded interviews with SRS customers and employees. Their stories recounted the emotional experience of losing data and seeing it brought back to life.</p> 
        <p>Through other case studies, ethnographic research and reviews it became apparent that a majority of SRS customers experienced a wide range of emotions during the recovery process.</p>

        <p>Not every repair was bound to be a success. How would we deliver bad news to a customer? And what exactly could go wrong?</p>
        <p>To answer that question we considered the journey and the emotional state of our user. We listed potential outcomes and negative reactions a user might feel. From our list we penned out the flows in plain text and showed this simple diagram to our client.</p>
        <p>Our lo-fi flow let us share assumptions with stakeholders and team members before investing in wireframes.</p>

        <h3 class="subheading-icon-small">Wireframes</h3>
        <p>A funny thing happened on the way to the wireframes: I wrote most of the copy. SRS’ copywriters liked it enough to keep it in the final products.</p>
        <p>We approached this project knowing that lorem ipsum just wasn't going to cut it. After all, writing is a design tool. I tried to omit needless words to avoid room for misinterpretation.</p>
        <p>It was also important for the copy to show an empathetic tone. Customers were waiting on pins and needles. We made a point of reassuring them real live humans were on standby to help.</p>
        <p>The typography and white space established basic visual design elements. Previous project's lo-fi wireframes helped the team but confused the client. We chose to use their branding to make it easier to move on to the design phase.</p>
        <p>Each wireframe followed a progression. We prefaced  them with a short description of what stage the user occupied in the flow.</p>

        <p>Traditional specification documents are weighty tomes. We described the basic details of the user experience to move the design forward.</p>
        <p>We made the document approachable to encourage team members to take part. We used screenshots from the final design to make it realistic. We then annotated each screen with corresponding numbers for easy reference. And finally, we provided user context along with a unique ID and title for each screen.</p>

        <p>I recorded a screencast and walked the client through the wireframes. This approach helped us win over a difficult stakeholder who liked to have things explained slowly.</p>
        <p>One unexpected benefit of presenting our work in a screencast was catching those unanticipated "gotchas" we would have missed if we'd jumped right in to a meeting.  We smoothed them over before passing it along to our project manager and quality assurance crew.</p>
        <p>The client was delighted by the concept and we moved to gathering feedback in Notable.</p>

<!-- Hiccups -->
<div class="row bump-90">
  <div class="medium-8 medium-centered large-6 columns">
    <h1 class="heading">Hiccups</h1>
    <h2 class="subheading-icon-small">The Form</h2>
    <p>The form would need to be translated in 7 other languages for some 18 countries.</p>
    <p>Seperate regions of the world handled payment processing differently. Adapting to these challenges was difficult because new requests arrived piece-meal almost weekly.</p>
    <p>To overcome the disjointed requests we adapted to a more agile approach and worked in tandem with front-end developers and engineers to see them through to completion.</p>
    <h2 class="subheading-icon-small">The Tracker</h2>
    <p>We originally planned to use the color red for failed recovieries. But we learned from customers that red invoked a harsh reaction.</p> <p>We opted for yellow instead and informed customers in the status message below that they could call SRS anytime, or SRS would be in touch within 48 hours.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<!-- Results -->
<div class="row bump-90">
  <div class="medium-8 medium-centered large-6 columns">
    <h1 class="heading">Results</h1>
    <h2 class="subheading-icon-small">The Form</h2>
    <p>A lack of upfront pricing was a major deterrent for prospects. We remedied this by asking prospects for two vital pieces of information at the top of the form:  country and media type. Once chosen, an estimate appeared for the evaluation and final cost.</p>
    <p>The upfront pricing regained customer's momentum.</p>
    <p>To keep them in motion a large number of redundant form fields were removed thanks in part to conditional logic. Thus reducing the average form completion time from 9m 30s to 2m 10s. The form's conversion rate increased in the first quarter by 130%.</p>
    <h2 class="subheading-icon-small">The Tracker</h2>
    <p>The tracker itself was the solution to reducing high call volumes. By integrating the UPS API into our checkout form new customers were given immediate access to the tracker. This bumped up customer engagement online by 200% and reduced call load signifcantly.</p>
    <p>Because we chose not to use passwords for the tracker&rsquo;s login page &mdash; instead, case numbers &mdash; reps could now look up a customer's case status without asking them to divulge a password.</p>
