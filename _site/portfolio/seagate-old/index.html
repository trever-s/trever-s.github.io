    <p>On a tight schedule, I worked with a talented team of managers, engineers and designers, and was responsible for all aspects of the user exeperience.</p>
    <p>Because user experience was one of the three tenets for our client's new business model, I was involved early on in the project lifecycle.</p>
    <p>I framed initial conversations with the client, prepared aspects of the brief and scope, conducted research, desiged artifacts, provided oversight after handoffs, and monitored the continual improvement of the project's KPIs post launch.</p>

        <p>Seagate manufactures more hard drives than any other business in the world. The company houses over 50,000 employees along with a number of divisions which embody several aspects of data storage.</p>
        <p>Seagate Recovery Services, otherwise known as SRS, specializes in retrieval of missing data from most any storage device.</p>
        <p>SRS is comprised of managers who handle strategic operations, the technicians who salvage the lost data, and a sales teams which doubles as customer support.</p>

        <p></p> 
        <p>From photos, to film footage and spreadsheets and more, data is closely tied to human welfare. SRS understand they are in a unqiue position to offer a reassuring experience.</p>
        <p>Their target audience is typically still in shock from discovering they've lost significant data on their hard drive or other storage media.</p>
        <p>When customers first approach SRS emotions run high. People are looking for trust signifiers. Does it look professional? Is the pricing up front? Are the instructions self explanatory? Offering up reassurance can make or break someone in a vunerable position to hand over their hard drive.</p>

<!-- Early Research -->
<div class='row bump-90'>
  <div class='small-10 small-centered columns'>
    <div class='row'>
      <div class='small-6 columns'>
        <h2 class='subheading'>Early Research</h2>
        <p>What was the root cause of the unusually high abandonment rates? Initial Task Analysis with users confirmed a variety of issues, both experential and technical, contributed.</p>
        <p>The biggest culprit was a lack of pricing discloure up-front. Users had to fill out a form first before receving a price quote. In stakeholder interviews with both customer and client people spoke of 'low risk to reward ratio.'</p>
        <p>Which lead us to our second problem: fatique. User complained about the 5-step form, with 87 unique fields, they were expected to fill out. Using metrics provided by the client we were able to confirm users left the form at the beginning or in the middle of filling it out.</p>
        <p>And our third ranking complaint was an actual technical issue, or a poor choice of functionality, which prevented users from filling out a form field before the previous one was completed. This was made worse by the fact that the form fields were paired side-by-side and some international audiences were confused about the order they should fill the form out.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='small-6 columns'>
        <h2 class='subheading'>A Simpler Business Model</h2>
        <p>SRS was simplifying its business model by offering up-front pricing and faster turn-around times on repairs. This gave us the flexibility and support from the client we needed to make some radical changes to the way the form looked and behaved.</p>

    <p>Along with helping them rebuild the form, and customer journey, they also had a tracker in mind, akin to a Domino’s popular pizza delivery tracker, but for customers to track their hard drive recovery.
