            Our client – a major tech company – runs a network of 91,000 businesses. Business affiliates join to increase time-to-market, generate leads, and grow revenue. Managers act as their go-between to navigate this network. One day, they were gone. Replaced by an online self-service portal. Affiliates struggled to adapt. The client hired us to study the actors, describe new products, and recommend a path forward.

          <!-- Challenge -->
          <p class="case-focus">To kickoff the project, my team's first goal was to become fluent enough in our client's world to earn their partnership. We used desk research, client interviews, and a hypothesis workshop. We asked stakeholders in the workshop, “how would you describe your customer’s end-to-end experience in the affiliate network?” The session gave us proto-personas, rough journey maps, and plenty of open questions. We now wondered, "how might me use this data to explore knowledge gaps in customer interviews?"</p>
          <h2 class="case-title">Solution</h2>
          <!-- Solution -->
          <p class="case-focus">I proposed an update to our research plan. Like the journey maps our client created, we orchestrated a co-creation exercise for participants. My team agreed that this method would allow us to test several hypotheses.</p>

This forced them to travel in roundabout ways and take on new mindsets. But why? The answers came together on our affinity board.</li>
            <li><span class="peach">&#10124;</span> Affiliates were effected by conditions out of their control, but caused by our client unintentionally. Managers had higher priorities so they took a back seat. Sales tools had bugs that never got fixed causing leads to vanish. Weeks went by without support.

Affiliates, no surprise, shirked convention. They did the opposite of traveling in a linear pathway, moving along the journey backward, forward, even in roundabout loops. This jolted the client’s understanding of their Affiliates, paving the way for an unusual deliverable.</p> -->

          <!-- Challenge -->
          <p class="case-focus">
          Here's the messy the part (you gotta have a messy part, right?). We tried to shoehorn our interview synthesis board into a journey map-esque spreadsheet. Helpful for identifying milestones. Not so helpful if the route customers take to get to the milestones looks like a roller coaster. What we learned about Affiliates required pause for an alternative deliverable. Not a journey map, like the one engraved in the statement of work. No. Something like a board game that forced players to experience the frustrations voiced by Affiliates.</p>
          <p class="case-focus">Our internal leadership balked at the pitch. But often the spirit of research is to welcome the occasional raised eyebrow. It means you're on to something. With constructive dialog we found a compromise together. By walking the client through our findings, they would need to arrive at a similar conclusion. The client’s exact words were, “this could be a game.” It was t-minus one week to prepare a finished product.</p>
          <h2 class="case-title">Solution</h2>
          <!-- Solution -->
          <p class="case-focus">I’ve struggled in the past with behemoth synthesis sessions. I championed just-in-time synthesis. The rolling debriefs sped up the bid to sprinkle customer quotes across the milestones on game board. We held a working prototype session in the studio painting dice. Through open invites to play the game, we laughed when players hit landmines (losing a turn), and riffed until it was ready to go to print.</p>

          <!-- Outcome -->
          <h2 class="case-title">Outcome</h2>
          <p class="case-focus">
             Several concepts have gone into production. First quarter reports showed a 29% increase in Affiliate engagement. Our recommendations laid the groundwork. The client is adopting new modes of listening and learning from their customer. We instilled the confidence required to make more effective future improvements to their Affiliate network.

          <h2 class="case-title">Next steps</h2>
          <p class="case-focus">One month later, we were back at it, presenting the board game to our client’s leadership team. Requests to “play the game” continued to roll in.</p>

          <p class="case-focus">Our research plan is a guide, never a rulebook. Nascent observations, if we’re paying attention, demand a new direction. I’m proud of this work, both parties displayed a willingness to pursue uncomfortable truths for the sake of the customer’s well-being. Research that travels far must come from a place of collective ownership within an organization.</p> -->
