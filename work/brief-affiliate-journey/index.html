            Imagine a SaaS product that lets you develop your business on the backbone of one of the largest technology companies in the world. One day, your assigned manager can no longer help you expand your business. Life changed for 50,000 Affiliates in the network. The replacement? A self-service portal with a suite of marketing and sales tools. Affiliates were not happy. The survey data that raised this portal wasn’t robust enough to tell our client why it was failing. Fjord was hired to round out this quantitative puzzle. We conducted in-depth stakeholder, customer, and desk research, collaborated with the client at each turn, and delivered self-service concepts.

          <!-- Challenge -->
          <p class="case-focus">We asked the client in the first week, “how would you describe your customer’s experience as an affiliate in the network?” To find out, my team ran a hypothesis workshop. The session gave us proto-personas, sticky note journey maps, and plenty of open questions client's had about their customers. Now we wondered, how might me use this data to explore knowledge gaps in our upcoming interviews?</p>
          <h2 class="case-title">Solution</h2>
          <!-- Solution -->
          <p class="case-focus">I altered our customer research plan when my team agreed to include a journey map co-creation exercise similar to what we'd done in the hypothesis workshop. This was the perfect opportunity to test what we'd learned from our client. Logistically, rather than rely on our team to piece together each customer’s journey from transcripts, we could also produce the deliverable during the session.</p>

          <p class="case-focus">Our team had built a cumulative knowledge of the Affiliate Network. We didn’t know we were about to unearth our insight: circuitous routes. "Circuitous what?" Affiliates, no surprise, shirked convention. They did the opposite of traveling in a linear pathway, moving along the journey backward, forward, even loop-the-loops. This jolted the client’s understanding of their Affiliates, paving the way for an unusual deliverable.</p>

          <p class="case-focus">Research performed in complex time envelopes is about making the right trade-offs. A constraint we dealt with was a lack of candidates who were newer customers. In hindsight, we'd have sought to understand how time affects the collected data with a longitudinal diary study.</p>

          <!-- Challenge -->
          <p class="case-focus">An attempt to map out the affiliate's journey in a spreadsheet raised eyebrows. How might we assert that customer's mindsets shifted based on circumstance? My colleague and I proposed a journey map with mechanics that simulated this effect for board game players. Leadership balked. But often the spirit of research is to challenge sacred cows. With constructive dialog, we found a compromise: walk the client through our findings, if they arrive at the same conclusions we did, we had leadership's blessing. I remember the client’s exact words were, “this could be a game.” We had one week to develop a finished product.</p>
          <h2 class="case-title">Solution</h2>
          <!-- Solution -->
          <p class="case-focus">I’ve struggled in the past with behemoth synthesis sessions. This time I championed just-in-time synthesis, a mini daily rolling debrief which sped up the bid to compile quotes on the board game. More push back again meant we redoubled our effort, holding a working prototype session in the studio. Through open invitations to play the game we laughed and riffed until the game board and pieces were packaged up for the workshop.</p>

          <p class="case-focus">The workshop teams were ready to seize this newfound empathy and turn it into dollars. We moved through a series of exercises. Iterated mockups. Prioritized twelve winners. Over two weeks, my team worked with the client to bring those ideas into their finished form. Our efforts resulted in a final deliverable, a toothsome slide deck full of concept storyboards.</p>
          <!-- Reflection -->
          <h2 class="case-title">Reflection</h2>
          <p class="case-focus">The client felt suspicious. Their “organization held apprehensions of outside research” that upended their beliefs. It was awesome that we had developed a rapid candor with their team. With a time machine, I would have reached back and walked them through how we landed on our conclusions, leveraging their data (not just ours). Our desk research was meticulous. The team reviewed white papers while talking to the researchers who wrote the darned reports. Our analysis touched on at least two data points (let’s not get carried away). This grounded our evidence in convergent validity.</p>

I stepped in to become the teams interim design lead. It was easy. I worked with amazing professionals.</p>

          <!-- Solution -->
          <p class="case-focus">At Fjord, even in the fuzzy front-end, we try to communicate design’s purpose to the client. It’s occasionally a dog and pony show, sure. There’s a genuine enthusiasm to show we love our work. This stokes the collaborative fires. Stepping into a transitional leadership role, I took those same ethos to heart.</p>
          <p class="case-focus">Is a designer a copywriter? The concept storyboards weren’t going to write themselves. We turned sketched concepts into polished storyboards. Along with concepts, we told the story of how we reached our recommendations. With solid research, heavy client participation, and a product roadmap. We did one better. We provided both a long-term and short-term vision, detailing its impact to our client.</p>
          <p class="case-focus">The hand-off document is akin to slipping a message in a bottle into the open sea. You have no idea who will open it. You want the reader to see they’ve stumbled upon a message written just for them. The letter should steer confidence in the reader. It will show that you considered their business from the inside out, examined their organizational capabilities, and became intimate with their customer’s unmet needs. That’s what we achieved in the final act of this work.</p>

          <h2 class="case-title">Outcome</h2>
          <p class="case-focus">
             Several concepts have gone into production. First quarter reports showed a 29% increase in Affiliate engagement. Our recommendations laid the groundwork. The client is adopting new modes of listening and learning from their customer. We instilled the confidence required to make more effective future improvements to their Affiliate network.

          <p class="case-focus">One month later, we were back at it, presenting the board game to our client’s leadership team. Requests to “play the game” continued to roll in.</p>

          <p class="case-focus">Our research plan is a guide, never a rulebook. Nascent observations, if we’re paying attention, demand a new direction. I’m proud of this work, both parties displayed a willingness to pursue uncomfortable truths for the sake of the customer’s well-being. Research that travels far must come from a place of collective ownership within an organization.</p> -->

          <blockquote class="quote-plum">Trever was the glue that held the two phases of the project together. He was my personal go to for questions I had, or input I needed to move forward. He took on a great deal of ownership of the final deliverables, providing content, useful visual direction, and stellar copy. Besides being professional, reliable, available, and communicative, Trever is just a pleasant person to work with. He has a confident demeanor and an easy-going personality, handling challenges with humor and tact. This team trusts and respects Trever as a leader.<span>&mdash; Ki, Senior Visual Designer</span></blockquote>
