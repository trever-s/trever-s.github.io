            Our client is a household name, who alongside other pursuits hosts a business-to-business subscription network. Organizations partner up with our client to take advantage of their robust technology offerings. Two years prior, human support was removed across the network for the majority of non-enterprise affiliates and replaced with a self-service online portal. The portal &ndash; conceived mostly by survey data feedback &ndash; was failing to help customer's accomplish their goals. Fjord was hired over 10 weeks to conduct robust generative user research, closely collaborate with the client's stakeholders, and deliver concepts on a realistic release timeline.

          <p class="case-focus">To solve the mystery, I modified our research plan and designed an activity to engage particpants in storytelling and visualization.

          <h2 class="case-title">Next steps</h2>
          <p class="case-focus">The co-creation journey exercise surfaced a crucial insight: customers don't travel in a linear path seen on conventional journey maps. Instead, they move forward, backward, and even in serpentine loops to navigate the ecosystem. This discovery jolted the client's understanding of their customer, paving the way for a surprising deliverable.</p>
          <!-- Reflection -->
          <h2 class="case-title">Reflection</h2>
          <p class="case-focus">Research performed in complex time envelopes is often about making the right trade-offs. A constraint we dealt with was a lack of canidates who were newer customers. In hindsight, we may have proposed a longitudinial diary study to understand how time affects the data being collected.</p>

          <h2 class="case-title">Workshop challenge</h2>
          <!-- Challenge -->
          <p class="case-focus">When we first mapped out the affiliate journey we realized it had to be from their perspective. It needed to take into account 1500 surveys, 12 in-depth interviews, 12 co-created journey maps, and 12 in-depths stakeholder interviews.</p>
          <p class="case-focus">To reflect their unique experiences we proposed a journey map turned interactive board game. Leadership balked. But often the spirit of research is to challenge sacred cows. With constructive dialogue, we found a compromise: walk the client through our findings, if they arrive at the same conclusions, we had the green light from leadership. The client's exact words were, ”this could be a game.“ We had one week to develop a finished product for our mid-way workshop.</p>
          <h2 class="case-title">Solution</h2>
          <!-- Solution -->
          <p class="case-focus">I've struggled in the past with behemoth synthesis sessions. This time I championed just-in-time synthesis, a mini and daily rolling debrief which accelerated our ability to compile quotes for the board game. Still receving some pushback internally, we redoubled our effort holding a working prototype session ahead of schedule. Through iterative gameplay with unsuspecting studio mates, we laughed, tweaked, and riffed until the game was ready for the printing press.</p>

          <p class="case-focus">The board game was not just a journey map with a pair of dice. It packed an emotional punch &ndash; a microcosmic whiff of real life encounters with customers.</p>

          <h2 class="case-title">Next steps</h2>
          <p class="case-focus">The remainder of the day saw a convergence of minds co-creating and prioritizing twelve key concepts. We took these concepts further, working closely with the client to itterate on their final form over the next two weeks. This resulted in a fifty-page deck with seven concept storyboards, detailing minimum and long-term integration strategies on a product roadmap.</p>
          <!-- Reflection -->
          <h2 class="case-title">Reflection</h2>
          <p class="case-focus">The client had a long history of using quantitative data to inform and guide their decision-making processess. Clearly though, something was hindering their ability to translate survey feedback into successful products. Our desk research mixed with qualitative inquiry gave us at least two data points to show the evidence we gathered was grounded in convergent validity. Spending more time emphasizing this approach may have altered the client's long-term design research strategy.</p>

          <!-- Outcome -->
          <h2 class="case-title">Outcome</h2>
          <p class="case-focus">
             The work has since gone into production with many of our concepts responsible for an  engagement increase of 29% in the first quarter. We laid the groundwork that allowed our client to adopt new modes of listening and learning from their customer. Giving them the confidence required to make less risky future product and service improvements.
          </p>
          <!-- Next Steps -->
          <h2 class="case-title">Next steps</h2>
          <p class="case-focus"> One month after the project ended we were back at it again presenting the board game to our client’s leadership team. Seventy people attended the event and it was described by many as a 'casino floor' like atmosophere. The event made waves and before I left Fjord, client requests to "play the game" continued to roll in.</p>
          <!-- Reflection -->
          <h2 class="case-title">Reflection</h2>
          <p class="case-focus">For consultants, the proposal and the statement of work chart the project map &ndash; and write the check &ndash; before everything is underway. And as it so often does, our exploratory research unearthed nascent insights that demanded a new heading. I'm proud of this work because both parties displayed a willingness to pursue uncomfortable truths for the sake of the customer's well-being. Research that travels far must come from a place of collective ownership within an organization.</p>
          <!-- Shout out -->
          <blockquote class="quote-plum">Trever was the glue that held the two phases of the project together. He was my personal go-to for any questions I had, or input I needed to move forward. He took on a great deal of ownership of the final deliverables, providing content, useful visual direction, and stellar copy. In addition to being highly professional, reliable, available, and communicative (all remotely), Trever is just an incredibly pleasant person to work with. He has a confident demeanor and an easy-going personality, handling challenges with humor and tact. This team trusts and respects Trever — something that cannot be understated in a leader.<span>&mdash; Ki, Senior Visual Designer</span></blockquote>
