          <p class="case-intro black">Our client hosts a paid network where businesses can market and sell the client's software and hardware as their own. In the past, these businesses leaned on managers to guide them through online training, co-marketing, and sales activities. But managers were diminished and replaced by self-service tools that Affiliates struggled to adopt. The client hired us over 10 weeks to study current behaviors, identify opportunities to boost engagement and recommend a product roadmap.

          <p class="case-focus case-rationale"><span class="case-rationale-title">Disclaimer</span>One of my muses, field researcher, Chip Jancase, said "the risk is that by sharing something, the researcher may be perceived &hellip; to be sharing everything." The work I do is confidential, an upstream activity, and the outcomes can take years to play out. The work you'll see in the case study are snapshots that demonstrate problem and resolution thinking.</p>

          <h2 class="case-title">Research challenges</h2>

          <p class="case-focus">In consulting, the proposal often sets the approach and the budget. With very little lead-in, research can unearth new information demanding we change direction in the pursuit of higher quality data. And this can only happen when we educate the client along the way about the benefits of what we're learning.</p>

          <p class="case-focus">Each project is an chance to try anew. The client had a long history of using quantitative data to inform and guide their decision-making processess. Our project kicked-off with desk research to collate, and it was important for us to understand who owned that process, and how it effected sales figures, brand-tracking studies, marketing-sizing, and segmentation. Once we reviewed the 1500 users surveyed in our target user base, we understood the strengths and weaknesses we  turned to in-depth interviews. This approach gave us at least two data points to show the evidence we gathered was grounded in convergent validity.</p>

          <p class="case-focus">In consulting, the proposal often sets the approach and the budget. Research often unearths new information demanding we change direction. And this can only happen when we educate the client along the way about the benefits of what we're learning.</p>

          <p class="case-focus">Why was our first methodology in-depth interviews? Understanding not one, but two audiences. The client's organization that hired us. And the people they serve, affiliates, or users. What are their current behaviors, routines, and motivations? The goal of understanding stakeholders is to understand how they perceive their users, the tools and services they provide, and the organization as a whole.</p>

          <p class="case-focus">Fjord qualitative studies tend to run swiftly, and recording and translating huge data sets takes place under short timescales. We coordinate with client project managers to establish logistics and recruiting. Before I began this project myself and another design researcher conducted and analyzed forty-one field and remote interviews in just under two weeks. We had a roomier five weeks of primary research on this project. We split our front-end investigation between two audiences: stakeholders and affiliates (the client's users). Gaining our client's confidence and perspective was the first hurdle. After identifying which stakeholders owned what part of the affiliate experience, we put together a research framework with the end goal of articulating the client's current understanding of their users. We then conducted three weeks of in-depth interviews, and audited sixty-one programs, services, and tools.</p>

          <p class="case-focus">If the first challenge was becoming subject matter experts, the second challenge was demonstrating our newfound knowledge back to the client. Striking a balance between becoming an expert and remaning naïve meant hosting a ”hypothesis” workshop. We presented six pervasive themes we uncovered across multiple touchpoints. The workshop lent a forum for a series of design thinking exercises. We converged from defining persona archetypes to building personal journeys for all three.</p>

          <p class="case-focus">Stakeholders in the workshop were surprised by how little they knew about the affiliate's needs and motivations. Gathering everyone together in one room underscored this problem. Now we needed to devise a methodology in our upcoming user interviews that could better describe the affiliate's end-to-end process.</p>

          <h2 class="case-title">Research solutions</h2>

          <p class="case-focus">To solve our research challenge, I proposed two ideas to my team: an interview guide — not a script — that would allow us to chase the story. And an online activity to co-create a Customer Journey Map with participants. The first choice would both lower the fidelity of our note taking to improve the half-life of our data, and the latter would rapidly calibrate us to affiliate's relational history with the client's business.</p>

          <p class="case-focus">During the interview introductions, I'd give an outine of the two hours session, and mention the activity. After 10 minutes of warm-up questions to put interviees at ease, I sent an invite to the activity via chat. We found that introucing them to a visual framework helped participants build a mental model in their head of what we were trying to achieve. We could go back after the journey was completed to reference a point on the board, and then dig in deeper to uncover powerful anecdotes and details we may have missed.</p>

          <p class="case-focus">After two weeks, we had reached our first goal. The team had compiled all of the journeys into one MURAL board. And we felt confident that those gaps we'd seen in our hypothesis workshop were narrowing. What we learned about affiliate behavior would challenge our stakeholders assumptions to their core and change our approach to the problem.</p>

          <h2 class="case-title">Reflection</h2>

          <p class="case-focus">Research performed in complex time envelopes is often about making the right trade-offs. A constraint we dealt with was a lack of users who were relativley new to our client's network. In hindsight, we may have proposed a longitudinial study to understand how time affects the data being collected.</p>

          <p class="case-focus">At this moment my team was saturated with data gathered across MURAL, OneNote, backup recordings, post-its, groups chats, workshops, slide decks, photographs, screenshots, videos, and, in our heads. The prospect of conjuring up meaning is daunting. I struggled in the past using dedicated synthesis sessions. This time I championed just-in-time synthesis, a mini and daily debrief. With this strategy, my team was able to ask smarter questions as interviews piled up. Our shared understanding gave us liberty to rearrange data quickly and explore options together without reaching premature conclusions. From this approach, we took manageable risks, and explored the possibility of alternative artifacts and frameworks like Board Games and Mindsets.</p>

          <p class="case-focus">Each project is an chance to try anew. The client had a long history of using quantitative data to inform and guide their decision-making processess. It was important for us to understand who owned that process, and how it effected sales figures, brand-tracking studies, marketing-sizing, and segmentation. Once we reviewed the 1500 users surveyed in our target user base, we understood the strengths and weaknesses of this approach we turned to in-depth interviews. This approach gave us at least two data points to show the evidence we gathered was grounded in convergent validity.</p>

          <p class="case-focus">The truth about affiliates is that they wanted badly to become managed by our client. And not just managed, they wanted to talk to a human. The lenghts they went to seek out help was directly tied to their inability to move forward in the network. And almost all we talked to had one end goal: become managed and sell my product/service alongside the client. There was a catch though. Even for affiliates who were managed, there were moments they felt unmanaged. We begin to assign unique traits to not users, but mindsets, that dictated how and when users behaved at different stages of the network.</p>

          <p class="case-focus">The board game was not just a journey map with a pair of dice. It was an entirely new framework to introduce stakeholders to the user's true intentions. It's an emotionally enduring and rewarding experience. A microcosmic whiff of real life encounters with the client's business.</p>

          <p class="case-focus">I like to plunge stakeholders into research findings headfirst with role-playing &mdash; skits, pitches, and in this case, board games. Reenactments give participants the freedom to suspend disbelief and develop empathy for their customer.</p>

          <p class="case-focus">How did we arrive at a board game for our final research share out? It began with two insights:</p>
          <ul class="case-focus-list">
            <li>The journey isn’t linear. Affiliates moved through a series of circuitous routes fixated on one destination.</li>
            <li>Affiliates operate not as a fixed persona, but a series of mindsets with fluid expectations, needs, and goals, that shift through circumstance.</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="case-focus">Both insights culminated from several weeks of debriefings and prioritization exercises. The team captured our notes on synthesis boards with the online tool, MURAL. Our synthesis boards described the participant’s role and takeaways, such as pain-points, opportunities, and "our biggest surprise." Naturally, patterns begin to appear. And we were mindful not to over-invest in outliers that played into our individual cognitive or behavorial biases. The next step was to construct relational groupings from salient data points and develop themes.
          </p>

          <p class="case-focus">
          At the end of the interviews, we duplicated the board. On the duplicate, we identified patterns and marked them as possible themes. These themes emerged as two insights. In this case, one of the insights is not as evident on the board. Many side conversations needed to take place organically for this insight to emerge.
          </p>

          <p class="case-focus">Our insights became the core of our gaming mechanics which we would use to describe our research to our stakeholders. And get them to partake in the research. My colleague and I began designing the game that would help us describe the non-linear nature of our participant's journeys. We shot sketches and white board drawings back and forth to each other via SMS trying to find a design that accurately portrayed their movements, behaviors, and goals.</p>

          <p class="case-focus">The spirit of our practice is to challenge assumptions and sacred cows. Based on what the research team observed, we were questioning a traditional Journey Map deliverable. And my colleagues were questioning our judgment. These are the moments as a researcher that excite you the most. Because walking them through our rationale helped solidify our point-of-view, and without critique, it's hard to know if you're on the right track.</p>

          <p class="case-focus">We used our team's feedback to slowly walk our client through our thought process and the data that led us to it, namely, how we observed participant's movements on the journey occurring in a non-linear fashion. And how even the most fortunate mindsets, the VIPs, often fell victim to the same challenges our less privileged mindset, the Ghost, experienced. This unpredictability created a "high road" and a "back road" division on our journey. And just like in our research, participants could end up on either road through a series of unexpected circumstances.</p>

          <p class="case-focus">One month after the initial project ended, we were back at it again, presenting the board game to our client’s leadership team at one of their more significant events. It was such a hit, the board game, and all sixteen gaming sets began to make the rounds on their campus. Before I left Fjord, client requests to ‘play the game’ continued.</p>

          <p class="case-focus">The board game wasn’t just a game; it was an empathy-building activity. When you play the game, you feel the same stressors that we observed in our research. Getting people in this headspace was the perfect way to catapult them toward convergent thinking and concept development.</p>
