            Imagine a SaaS product that lets you develop your business on the backbone of a name brand technology. One day, your assigned manager can no longer support your growth as an Affiliate in this network. The manager is replaced by a set of instructions to a self-service portal with a suite of marketing and sales tools. Affiliates were not thrilled. The survey data that backed this initiative also wasn’t robust enough to explain why it was failing. Fjord was hired to round out this quantitative puzzle using qualitative research to recommend a path forward.

          <!-- Challenge -->
          <p class="case-focus">We asked the client in the first week, “how would you describe your customer’s experience as an affiliate in the network?” To find out, my team ran a hypothesis workshop. The session gave us proto-personas, sticky note journey maps, and plenty of open questions client's had about their customers. Now we wondered, how might me use this data to explore knowledge gaps in our upcoming interviews?</p>
          <h2 class="case-title">Solution</h2>
          <!-- Solution -->
          <p class="case-focus">I altered our customer research plan when my team agreed to include a journey map co-creation exercise similar to what we'd done in the hypothesis workshop. This was the perfect opportunity to test what we'd learned from our client. Logistically, rather than rely on our team to piece together each customer’s journey from transcripts, we could also produce the deliverable during the session.</p>

          <p class="case-focus">Our team's cumulative understanding of customer behavior was about to unleash our insight: circuitous routes. "Circuitous what?" Affiliates, no surprise, shirked convention. They did the opposite of traveling in a linear pathway, moving along the journey backward, forward, even roundabout loops. This jolted the client’s understanding of their Affiliates, paving the way for an unusual deliverable.</p>

          <h2 class="case-title">Reflection</h2>
          <p class="case-focus">Research performed in complex time envelopes is about making the right trade-offs. A constraint we dealt with was a lack of candidates who were newer customers. In hindsight, we'd have sought to understand how time affects the collected data with a longitudinal diary study.</p>

          <!-- Challenge -->
          <p class="case-focus">A valiant attempt to record the affiliate's journey in a spreadsheet raised eyebrows. How might we assert that Affiliate mindsets shifted based on circumstance? My colleague and I proposed a journey map with game mechanics that simulated this effect on a board game. Leadership balked. But often the spirit of research is to challenge sacred cows. With constructive dialog, we found a compromise: if we walk the client through our findings, and they arrive at a similar conclusion, we had their blessing. The client’s exact words were, “this could be a game.” We had one week to prepare a finished product.</p>
          <h2 class="case-title">Solution</h2>
          <!-- Solution -->
          <p class="case-focus">I’ve struggled in the past with behemoth synthesis sessions. This time I championed just-in-time synthesis, a rolling debrief which sped up the bid to compile customer quotes on the board game. More push back again meant we redoubled our effort, holding a working prototype session in the studio. Through open invitations to play the game, we laughed and riffed until it was ready to go to print.</p>

          <h2 class="case-title">Reflection</h2>
          <p class="case-focus">The client felt suspicious. Their “organization held misgivings about outside research.” It was awesome that we had developed a rapport and they felt willing to share this detail with our team.

          <h2 class="case-title">Outcome</h2>
          <p class="case-focus">
             Several concepts have gone into production. First quarter reports showed a 29% increase in Affiliate engagement. Our recommendations laid the groundwork. The client is adopting new modes of listening and learning from their customer. We instilled the confidence required to make more effective future improvements to their Affiliate network.

          <p class="case-focus">One month later, we were back at it, presenting the board game to our client’s leadership team. Requests to “play the game” continued to roll in.</p>

          <p class="case-focus">Our research plan is a guide, never a rulebook. Nascent observations, if we’re paying attention, demand a new direction. I’m proud of this work, both parties displayed a willingness to pursue uncomfortable truths for the sake of the customer’s well-being. Research that travels far must come from a place of collective ownership within an organization.</p> -->

          <blockquote class="quote-plum">Trever was the glue that held the two phases of the project together. He was my personal go to for questions I had, or input I needed to move forward. He took on a great deal of ownership of the final deliverables, providing content, useful visual direction, and stellar copy. Besides being professional, reliable, available, and communicative, Trever is just a pleasant person to work with. He has a confident demeanor and an easy-going personality, handling challenges with humor and tact. This team trusts and respects Trever as a leader.<span>&mdash; Ki, Senior Visual Designer</span></blockquote>
