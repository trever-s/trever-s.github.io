          Push a button in an app, and it turns on your car — a simple enough idea. Yet, it took seven months of front-end generative and evaluative research to figure out why we — and other car apps — were failing to fulfill this essential function.</p>
          <p class="case-intro">
          The rating in the app store reflected my client's performance evaluations. My job was to help improve this metric. But first, I needed to get to know the client, my team, and the underlying problems for app users.</p>

          <p class="case-focus">I set out to research how automotive apps are used by vehicle owners so that I can improve our user's app experience.</p>
          <p class="case-focus">There's a strong correlation between a stakeholder's exposure to user behavior and product growth. During ongoing research activities, I invited numerous colleagues to help conduct research. I also hosted weekly shareouts to receive feedback and plan the next steps.</p>

          <p class="case-focus">I used the following methodologies for smaller feature-based turnarounds, and more significant findings delivered near the end of the project.</p>
          <ul class="case-focus-list">
              <li><strong>Guerilla intercept interviews.</strong> Why? The first thing I do before desk research is often go outside with my clipboard to meet users in the wild. This demonstrated to a handful of skeptical stakeholders that design research can deliver benefits in days, not weeks or months.</li>
              <li><strong>Desk research (including competitive analysis).</strong> I viewed countless YouTube videos of electric vehicle owners reviewing both our app and vehicles as well as competitors. I also consolidated app store reviews for dozens of similar apps and produce data visualizations for the team's consumption. I compared and contrasted strategies, like remote command, for nineteen vehicle apps.</li>
            </ul>

            <figcaption class='case-figcaption'>A detached vehcile console used for vehicle and app telemetry sits at my desk.</figcaption>
            <ul class="case-focus-list">
              <li><strong>Closed guerilla card sorts</strong> Now that I understood what features we offered in the context of our competitors, I was curious how users would prioritize the importance of those features based on company, vehicle, and power source (gas vs. hybrid or electric). This approach enabled me to look at the data in my analyses with an eye on feature prioritization. </li>
              <li><strong>Log analysis</strong> The app had several tracking implements, as well as log files from pings/requests to the company's servers. Why look here? Interpreting data across several years demonstrated historical user behavior based on criteria like "time on feature." But why did "time on feature" matter? Only qualitative research could provide the context.</li>
              <li><strong>Stakeholder and user interviews</strong> What the "data says" is often misleading. I sought out unstructured interviews to test assumptions and learn new details about motivations, needs, and opportunities gleaned from log analysis.</li>
              <li><strong>Ethnographic research</strong> I applied ethnographic participant observation as a 'secret shopper' at half-dozen dealerships to understand app awareness amongst sale associates. As well as continuity between in-vehicle and app experience. My investigation illustrated end-to-end continuity gaps for app users.</li>
            </ul>

            <figcaption class='case-figcaption'>Documenting the way the in-vehicle experience differed from the app surprised many stakeholders.</figcaption>
            <ul class="case-focus-list">
              <li><strong>Usability tests</strong> for problem discovery/validation. For these moderated remote tests, I asked new and existing app users to think-aloud while they performed a series of tasks. I chose this method to demonstrate to my team how to integrate recent findings into the user interface. </li>
              <li><strong>Shareouts</strong> These weekly hour-long sessions with the app development team brought the team together around users, offered a venue to conduct  light design thinking activities, and discuss research trajectories.</li>
          </ul>
          <blockquote>Trever brought an extremely collaborative way of demonstrating how we could improve the user experience for the app with a team of very non-design focused stakeholders. We’ve seen a noticeable uptick in positive reviews in the app stores. And the experiences he helped redesign have been extremely well received by both the client and the customers.<span>&mdash; Doug, Account Lead</span></blockquote>

          <p class="case-intro">After months of one-off and ongoing research two key insights surfaced from my synthesis board:</p>
          <ul class="case-focus-list white">
            <li class="white"><strong>Transactions first.</strong> Users treat the app as a transactional experience for remote vehicle commands. For other features we offer that fall outside of that category, like locating a charging station, they chose higher quality third-party apps.</li>
            <li class="white"><strong>Shoulder tap.</strong> The infrastructure to support remote commands like "start my car," is spotty at best. And these deficiencies were misdiagnosed by the client, and misperceived by the public, as User Experience problems.</li>
          </ul>
            <p class="case-intro">The most challenging aspect of this research was overcoming client pushback. A roadmap, plotted by features, no longer spoke to the value user's looked for in the app. Rather than ask the client to rip the bandage off and risk losing their trust, I gradually invited them and other stakeholders to research acitivites. This incremental approach, allowed everyone to buy-in on their own terms.</p>
            <p class="case-intro">Research showed our messaging should be honest when vehicle commands were issued in the app. E.G., "We are contacting your vehicle; this may take several minutes." Usability tests confirmed that being less cryptic about the process spoke to our specific audience types.</p>
            <p class="case-intro">These changes resulted in an up-tick in app store reviews, and an ongoing company-wide refresh of their system architecture. It also influenced the company's choice to double down infrastructure efforts in regions popular with electric vehicles.</p> 
            <p class="case-intro">And perhaps most importantly, a philosophical shift took place. User research had become a must-have mechanism for success. Customers were now at the center of strategic choices in the app's future.</p>
