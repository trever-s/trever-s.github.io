Big, abstract, raw. Of course, we’re talking about data. Noticeably absent from the list? Dirty.

Dirty data is a frightening occurrence. It goes hand in hand with _dead leads_, which can be the downfall of an otherwise successfully planned out and executed campaign. Think it’s too late for your marketing strategy to survive? If Gloria Gaynor can (see video), so can you and your campaigns! Check out a few key highlights from our “[Zombie Survival Guide - How to Avoid Dead Leads & Dirty Data](http://www.iron-point.com/campaigns/trick-or-treat/form/trick.html "Get free tricks - plus tasty treats!")” and take control of your marketing fate.

### Zombies & Leads – How Personas Protect Your Database
Providing leads with irrelevant content can turn them into non-responsive zombies. Let’s take a look at one of the _undead_, Shaun, a recently single electronics shop employee. Why then, you may be asking, is Shaun receiving nurture emails best suited for a father and husband celebrating his 25th wedding anniversary? Why isn’t he getting the exciting zombie-fighting tech news he signed up for? Simply put, a unique persona was never created for our bachelor friend, and he has fallen victim to receiving heaps of irrelevant emails. Another scary word for irrelevant emails? _Spam_.

Identifying personas and using them to segment your database is a hugely important, yet often overlooked, component of successful campaigns. If leads aren’t assigned personas from the get-go, how will you know what content they want to see?

Quite simply, you won’t, and Shaun will opt-out of receiving future emails and/or become a dreaded dead lead, all because he wasn’t asked to fill out a few additional questions on an opt-in form. Ain’t nobody got time to waste on emails that aren’t relevant to them, especially Shaun, who has a zombie apocalypse to prepare for.

**_Don’t let your leads die - or opt out! Create accurate personas for each and every one, and send them the content they want to see._**

### Data – Or Just Another Human?
To keep your leads from turning into the walking dead, we have to go beyond personas and think about people. Shaun is one, after all! Get to know your data — know what your leads like, what makes them tick, and even their personal best for running a mile (as you only need to be faster than the slowest person when out-running zombies)!

Treat your leads like real, complex humans. Engage and interact with them in a way that makes them feel appreciated. If we learned anything from Warm Bodies, it's that a little love goes a long way! So the next time you’re scrolling through your database, running metrics in your head, take a moment to remember that leads are people too.

**_When a lead receives emails that feel personal and useful, they are far less likely to opt-out or go cold._**

Think of all the mail you receive on a daily basis. Are you more likely to keep an email with coupons for a product you have neither heard of nor would ever be interested in? Or, an email with information about something near and dear to your heart? You know the answer; do the right thing, and show your leads you care.

### Bring Your Data To Life!
Now that you’ve segmented your leads based on personas, and are sending them relevant and engaging content, what next? Dig deeper into their actions of course! Your leads may be receiving the emails sent their way, and opening the majority of them, but are you tracking actions, analyzing metrics, and using lead scoring models? Are your leads clicking on the link to an open forum discussing whether Honest Abe was truly a killer of the un-dead, or the link to the quiz titled “Is Your Next Door Neighbor a Zombie?”

Paying attention to clicks, downloads, and page visits, to name a few, will help ensure the content you are sending is exactly what your audience wants and will be excited to receive.

**_Going the extra mile is always the way to go when trying to separate yourself from blood-thirsty competition!_**

If you’ve learned nothing else from this post, we hope that you remember no one went to see World War Z for the story line. We’re kidding, of course, although it is somewhat relevant to the point we’re trying to drive home. If you don’t take the time to get to know your leads, market to them accordingly, and dig deeper into their actions, you will be missing out on revenue, as well as the potential to turn your leads into long-term clients.
