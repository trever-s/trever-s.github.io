excerpt: "Email templates are oft-used to alleviate budgetary or time constraints, but how do they fit into your long-term marketing strategy? "

Email is a disposable medium. Statistics show that there are almost two billion emails  sent daily. If we printed out every email on a regular sheet of printer paper, that stack of paper would hit the moon in about a week.  We’d probably kill a lot of trees if we did that, though.

The point is, there are a heck of a lot of emails out there. On average, one out of three people in the world will send approximately one email, per person, per day. That’s a lot of people and a whole lot of emails.

Now, from politics to deadlines, many things influence your marketing workflow. Plans are changed, work-orders sent, fires started and put out, and marketing plans amended.  Because of the fast pace of email, it quickly becomes a place where many decisions are reactionary.

In design and coding, templates are often used to solve the problem of fast turn-times while maintaining a branded output.  However, it is all too easy to use a template based on a specific need that emerges at a single point in time.

The formula becomes: buy “X” template, where “X” is the general theme you need at the time. For example, planning out a newsletter email that blasts in a week, then buying a newsletter template, then trying to cram content to fit that template.

This approach very rarely works well.

Instead of using templates in a reactionary way, take an alternate approach, and consider examining the emails you are already sending.

See, your email marketing is a complicated, custom machine. You need tools that are built to fit. Custom tools. And custom built email templates may be one of several tools that can help simplify your workflow.

Check out all those emails you’ve built and are planning on building and start asking:

- Are there any sort of communications you could bucket together? 
- Is the volume of those buckets large enough to make a template worth the initial work-load and cost, and will it save you money in the long run?
- Would emails with similar designs help or hurt your brand?
- Are certain email tests performing better than others, and can you integrate that knowledge?
- Are there any designs that are already similar?
- Do you have the budget available for implementing changes?

If you are seeing trends in your email machine and you need to save some time, it might be worth the up-front effort of constructing one, or a whole, series of templates. 

Custom templates are amazing in their ability to expedite design, especially when deadlines are tight. Email deadlines are often tight.  With custom templates you’ll know exactly the branded tools at your disposal, letting you plan ahead more effectively and efficiently. 

Custom templates become another tool in your marketer’s toolbox.

It is important to remember that templates aren’t a magic marketing fix-all too. For creativity’s sake, no marketing plan should be entirely dictated by templates, else you run the risk of monotony and a plasticized brand with no room for innovation. When used appropriately, however, they can save you time and money.

Taking the time to look at your marketing machine will help determine if custom templates can streamline your process, and at the end of the day, who doesn’t like saving time and boosting ROI by pulling up a custom template, editing your content, and blasting it out?
