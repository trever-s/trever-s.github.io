You just received marching orders from your project manager. You're a little less excited about the upcoming work than the character Doc from _Back to the Future_, but whatever, it's still time to dust off the flux capacitor and lock in a date. Beep-bop-boop-blep: 1997.

Welcome to 1997. You arrive in a world innocent, a stage where you can easily surpass the coding prowess of any W3C-loving, SASS totin', web standarista — darn straight, you're an expert email coder. And wow, the 1997 job market is looking ripe.

Even if none of that made a lick of sense to you, hang with me because we're not going to get all technical up in here. No, we're simply talking about fallback styling for email.

What is fallback? Fallback is what happens when an email hits an inbox and images are disabled.
The problem is, fallback in many cases has gone overboard. At Iron-Point, we haven't taken it as far as some of the examples above, still, we got pretty silly a couple years back (one client asked us to cut down on it).

And, fellow coders, this fallback thing - when taken too far - has some negative side effects on the user, who:

+ Fails to see the value in loading images
+ Percieves the email as fully loaded
+ Thinks the company has changed brands
+ Can't recognize the email branding and marks it as spam
+ Feels overcome with an urge to play Atari video games (thus abandoning the email)

**A solution? Reel it in.**

By keeping fallback styling clean and simple, you can actually compel users to "click to load images."

Here are some tricks to get customers interested in viewing your full email in all its glory:

+ Style for structure, but not design (give your email a structure, or scaffolding, but don't design it).
+ Use compelling ALT attributes to game a reaction (blue beanies are gonna hunt me down for this — I know).
+ And finally, write damn good content outside of the images. Don't rely on images to convey information. Good content destroys facile debates about things like "Above the fold" and, you guessed it, the exaggerated importance of fallback styling in email marketing.


Follow these rules, and after the smoke clears you'll be victorious.

Until next time, keep coding like it's 1997 and I'll see you back in 2014.
