date:   2014-07-22
author: Dan Supinski
excerpt: "Business is booming. We&rsquo;re seeking a senior developer who's ready to lead a team, build iron-clad web products and have some fun along the way. Sound like you?"
---

Hi, we’re Iron-Point: a digital agency known for helping organizations make the most of marketing automation.

By day, we produce and manage large-scale online campaigns for tech startups and Fortune 500 organizations. By night, we have a core team of veterans hankering to bring our SaaS products to market.

That’s where you come in.

From the moment you join the Iron-Point team you’ll be in a position to lead, shape and grow our budding development team.

###Please bring

+ A vast background as a senior developer with both leadership and management experience. You’ve built complex websites, apps, or products before and you have a solid list of recent projects to show us.
+ Zeal. And lots of it. Did you see a recent conference talk that is blowing your mind? We want the person who is bursting at the seems to share, discuss — and perhaps even try it —, with their peers.
+ Entrepreneurship. We’re building products, and we’re a very small team. Translation: you have the opportunity to make a huge impact on our company and the industry. This means we’re completely open to trying new and proven ideas. Don’t like our waterfall methodology? There’s your cue to tune us in to lean or agile.
+ Mentorship. While helping build SaaS products, we’d like you to mentor our current junior devs. Take the time to build and grow a kick ass development team you can be proud to tell your grandchildren about.

###Must have skills

+ Expert: Java, Ruby, PHP, JavaScript, *SQL, Data Architecture, Git
+ Experience: Cloud services, Soap, REST, APIs, Unit testing, Design patterns, UML, MVC

###Nice-to-have skills

+ Marketing Automation: Eloqua, Marketo, Pardot, Acton, or Net-Results
+ Deployment: Amazon AWS, Heroku (Rails), Google Apps Engine
+ Workflow: Grunt.js, Bower, Sass
+ Other: APEX, Salesforce.com

###More about the position
We are an agency, and although you’ll be working on product development most of the time, we will occasionally require support on agency projects — about 80% product to 20% agency work.

###More about Iron-Point’s senior staff:

We’ve been going strong for over three years now. Our core team of veterans are hungry to bring products to market. We want the entire senior staff to jive. Everyone shares a diverse background in technology that spans well over a decade — yes, we can be very nerdy; often speaking to one another with animated gifs — making it important you’re cut from the same cloth.

###Some final words

+ This isn’t a fancy CTO position with a view from a highrise. You’ll be joining a team of eight professionals that have been in the startup trenches for a while. We’ll expect you to be on the same frequency with the other developers: leading, mentoring and coding each week.
+ We mentioned products earlier, and we have two in the works with our junior developers while one is ready for review. We need a leader who can step up and help us focus our current resources to get these products out on scope and on time.
+ It’s important you understand how to navigate the data-verse. Everything we work with will have a measurable component to it. This data will key us in to new feature rollouts, bugs, fixes, pretty much the evolution of our products. Knowing and respecting data will be fundamental.

###Job perks

+ New Hardware: MacBook Pro Retina, External Monitor, Standing Desk
+ Flexible Schedule\*
+ Casual Dress Code
+ Dog-friendly (if they’re friendly)
+ Health Benefits
+ Competitive Salary (40+ hours per week)
+ Significant Vesting Equity Stake
+ Great location (Downtown Denver, across from Union Station)

\*Open vacation policy. It suits us to stray from specific number of days off, and folks are encouraged to take time off as necessary. Seriously, this is pretty awesome.
