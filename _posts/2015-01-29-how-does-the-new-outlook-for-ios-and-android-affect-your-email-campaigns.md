If you're an email marketer, yesterday's news about Outlook's appearance on Apple and Android mobile devices has [probably reached your shores](http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/29/microsoft-launches-outlook-for-ios-and-android/ "TechCrunch article").

As a citizen of Seattle, and a relative of a Microsoft employee, I was granted an exclusive interview with the Microsoft Outlook mobile app himself. We sat down for a quick Q & A to find out what new changes we can expect him to bring to our email marketing landscape in 2015.

**Trever**: Mister Microsoft Outlook.

**Outlook**: Just call me Outlook.

**Trever**: Outlook, what does your new app for Android and iOS mean for email marketers today and in the coming weeks and months?

**Outlook**: OK, we're jumping right in huh? Well, first, it means that for anyone who uses Outlook on their desktop you can now freely use it on your tablet or phone. But be advised, I'm in "Preview" mode on Android at this time.

**Trever**: How does your arrival to mobile affect the business-to-business space?

**Outlook**: It's huge. I mean, even though Apple's iOS Mail and Gmail have [surpassed me](http://emailclientmarketshare.com "email client market research") in open-rates for business-to-customer recently, in business-to-business transactions Outlook is holding out for the number one spot. Bottom line, if you’re marketing business-to-business you should take news of my arrival on mobile devices very seriously.

**Trever**: Good to know. I'm an email developer, and I work with email marketers all the time. One of the things that drives us crazy is Outlook’s ability to ruin a perfectly coded email. Should email marketers be worried about adding a few more grey hairs to their developer’s heads with Microsoft Outlook’s mobile move?

**Outlook**: Probably… No, not really…Definitely….

**Trever**: Uh…

**Outlook**: Just kidding. But seriously, I’m heavily downloaded on both app stores. As we speak, Business Insider wrote an article about me titled [_Microsoft's New Email App For iPhone Persuaded Me To Delete Gmail After 5 Minutes_](http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-outlook-for-iphone-2015-1#ixzz3QEvn7izp "Business Insider article"), so I’m pretty hot stuff at the moment.  You've heard of [Litmus](http://www.litmus.com "Litmus") and [Email on Acid](https://www.emailonacid.com/ "Email on Acid") right?

**Trever**: For sure, those are email testing services developers and marketers live and die by.

**Outlook**: Exactly. Those guys don't even know about me yet. So the best thing an email marketer can do to guarantee email campaigns look sharp on my new app is to download me right now and test me out until those services catch up.

**Trever**: Not a bad idea. Is it free?

**Outlook**: It's free, and it even works with your iCloud, Gmail or Yahoo! account. (Grab the link to [Outlook for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id951937596 "Outlook on App Store") or [Android [Preview]](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.outlook "Outlook on Google Play").)

**Trever**: One last question.

**Outlook**: Anything for a fellow Seahawks fan.

**Trever**: Go Hawks! Do you support mobile-ready, AKA, responsive emails?

**Outlook**: No comment…I kid. Yes, as a matter of fact, I do. Basically, I'm a dressed up version of [Acompli](https://www.acompli.com/ "Acompli"), an email app Microsoft acquired a couple months back.

**Trever**: Last thoughts for our readers?

**Outlook**: Expect my transition to mobile to go a heck of lot better than my desktop ancestors.
