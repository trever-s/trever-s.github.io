With our first informational “treat", you learned that email marketing is a complicated, custom machine. While it’s extremely important to use tools that are unique to your brand, pre-existing templates exist to help out in a pinch when time may not be readily available.

When then, you must be wondering, is it appropriate to use a pre-existing template? Popular occasions that you want to ensure are noted, without having to spend a great deal of time focusing on, are prime examples. Lots of work anniversaries at the office in the month of April? Send a “Happy Anniversary” template to all who are celebrating! Need to wish those around you a happy holiday? A holiday-themed template is a great quick-win! 

While some of you may have finished your holiday shopping and card sending long ago, the vast majority of us will be spending the next few days scrambling for something tangible to show we are aware the holidays are here. Enter our second of three treats: [a FREE Holiday Email Template](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/391000/201412IPHolidayEmail.html.zip)!

Yours to keep, feel free to copy and paste into your email software of choice, and share with those around you. Enjoy, and stay tuned for our third and final “treat” we will be giving away before the New Year!
