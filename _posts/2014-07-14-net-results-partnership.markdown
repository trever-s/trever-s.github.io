I'm really excited to announce that we've partnered with Net-Results, a marketing automation solution. Now that the champagne is flowing, we hope to bring our customers a better class of marketing automation than we've seen in the past.

We first became aware of Net-Results three years ago, when I met their CEO, Michael Ward. Over time, we've watched their company grow and their platform evolve into one of most talked-about offerings out there today. And we think our clients are going to love what it can do to help them reach new heights.

We're also pumped that Net-Results is a local Colorado business. Their company culture encourages fitness, simplicity, and fun - values that hit close to home.

I've been working in the marketing automation industry for over six years now and I've been partnered with many of the other platforms. I've never been as excited about a partnership as I am with Net-Results. As a whole, we see great things coming from this new bond.

If you've also been in the industry for some time, you know a whopping 70% of MA subscribers only use 20% of their MA systems! This statistic should shock users everywhere. The money being left on the table is something we have pledged to fix with simpler and more efficient solutions. Net-Results is one of those solutions, and we feel better equipped with them in our corner.

Here's to new beginings!
