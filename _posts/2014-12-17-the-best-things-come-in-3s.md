The holiday season is officially upon us, and lucky for you, Iron-Point is a firm believer in indulging a little during this time of year! Cookies and cakes aside, we like to focus on the real treat - giving back to those who have helped us along our journey! Whether by [following us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/iron_point "Follow us on Twitter"), opting to receiving our emails, or reading our blog posts, what may seem like a small act to you means a great deal to us. 

To show our appreciation, Iron-Point will be gifting you with several treats over the coming days. Not a fan of surprises? We hear you. Being the holiday season and all, we will give you a hint as to what you can expect. We like to think that the best gifts have a unifying theme, and come in series of 3s. Little pigs, wise men, french hens, need we go on? 

While we can’t wrap what is coming, we hope our treats will both inform and delight you well into the new year. Enjoy, on us, and have a wonderful, indulgent, holiday season!

The Iron-Point Team
