title: Using Prose and Jekyll to write blog posts.

excerpt: "Prose is a GUI which allows users to easily create blog posts on the fly. You do not need to know how to write any code. Just follow the steps in this blog post and you will be on your way!"

### Step One
The first thing you need to do in order to get Prose up and running is to [fork the Repository](https://github.com/prose/prose/wiki/Getting-Started "Fork Repo for Prose") and then view on prose.io from [here.](http://prose.io/#USERNAME/starter)

If you do not understand how to fork a repository and get up and running, try to follow [this tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo "Github Fork Repo Tutorial"). If you are still unable to conquer GitHub and get your repository working, feel free to ask the nerds around your office to get you on your way.

### Step Two
Once you have Prose running and you can access the repository files to create a new post, you need to access the metadata tab on the right hand side of the screen.

*Meta Data Tab*

Be sure that you follow the format for the Date option and that you leave at least a two sentance description of the blog post you are creating. Do not enter any information for the Raw Metadata field.

### Step Three
Once you have your settings configured, it is time to start blogging! Click on the pencil shaped tab to get back to your editor and go ahead and erase all of the default information in the editor's workspace.

From here, creating the blog is as simple as typing a paper. You do not need to know any HTML and technically you don't even need to know any Markdown to get the post up. You can just enter plain text and save the blog. However, if you are interested in learning how to use Markdown to customize your blog post beyond what the GUI editor options allow you to do in Prose, please take a look at the [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) site by John Gruber to learn all about writing in Markdown.

###Final Steps

Lastely, once your blog is finished you can preview it from the second tab down on the right hand side of the editor to be sure that it looks exactly as you want it to.

If you are happy with both the content and the look of your post, click on the fourth tab down shaped like an old floppy disk, type a very brief description of your post (try 20 words or less) in the "Commit" text box and then press commit. Finally, on the top right of your editor bar, be sure to click "Unpublished". It will then turn to "Published" and your blog post will be added to the website.

This is an unpolished blog post on how to quickly create a post using Prose. A more detailed explanation will be updated to the post shortly. Thanks for reading.
