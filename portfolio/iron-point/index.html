    <p>We interviewed our target audience: two-dozen Fortune 500 senior marketers, each placed in different technology companies, and responsible for making purchasing decisions.</p>
    
    <p>As well as interviews, we sent out surveys asking what marketers would do on our website when looking to acquire an agency specializing in CRM and Marketing Automation solutions.</p>

    <p>It turned out that most of them had a number of decisions which were scattered, if not impossible, to pinpoint through targeted messaging. However, there were quite a few similarities, even if the language marketers used to describe their needs was varied.</p>

    <p>We used our research and developed a detailed persona document, along with customer stories, as a byproduct of what was learned about our target audience. The persona document quickly became a fixture for strategic conversations across the company.</p>

    <p>We went overboard and created too many personas. Even though it was a good idea to divide them in half by Decision Makers and Influencers we may have given each persona too much backstory.</p>

    <h1 class="heading">Results</h1>
    <p>We were able to idenitfy and devise a content strategy based around three major concerns marketers expressed when they sought out an agency.</p>
    <p>The insight we gathered and content strategy built around it was a success. Within three months we had a 18% increase in new business acquisition through the Homepage, Blog and social media. In six months we had an increase of 26% and growing.</p>
