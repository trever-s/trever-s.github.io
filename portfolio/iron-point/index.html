    <p>We interviewed our target audience: two-dozen Fortune 500 senior marketers, each placed in different technology companies, and responsible for making purchasing decisions.</p>
    <p>As well as interviews, we sent out surveys asking what marketers would do on our website when looking to acquire an agency specializing in CRM and Marketing Automation solutions.</p>
    <p>It turned out most of them carried a sizable amount of decisions to consider before signing a contract. On the other hand, there were quite a few similarities, even if the language marketers used to describe their needs varied.</p>
    <p>We used our research and developed a detailed persona document, along with customer stories, as an artifact of what was learned about our target audience.</p>

    <p>We went overboard and created too many personas. Even though it was a good idea to divide them in half by Decision Makers and Influencers we may have given each persona too much backstory.</p>

    <h1 class="heading">Results</h1>
    <p>The personas quickly became a fixture for strategic conversations across the company. We were able to devise a content strategy around three major concerns marketers expressed when they sought out an agency thanks to the intel we gathered on our customer&rsquo;s motivations, behaviors and goals.</p>
    <p>A personal feather-in-my-cap moment happened when a co-founder defended an idea in a meeting from the perspective of the persona, Pattie. Fast forward several months later and team members are voicing their opinion from the perspective of our personas on a weekly basis.</p>
    <p>In the end the insight we gathered from this exercise contributed to the organizations overall sense of purpose from the top down. Within three months we witnessed an 18% increase in new business acquisition through the homepage, blog and social media.</p>

    <p>To this day we are still revisiting our personas when we learn something new about them. Several team members have decided to take on roles to contribute to our UX artifacts that help shape the overall strategy of the business.</p>
