    <p class='heading'>Hi, I&rsquo;m Trever.</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m a designer with a background in front-end development and a knack for typography. I became an advocate for user-centered design while learning how to fold Web standards into my code almost a decade back.</p>
    <p>Currently, I&rsquo;m an interaction designer at Fjord. Some of our clients include T-Mobile, Microsoft, Costco, and even the Seattle Mayor&rsquo;s office.</p>
    <p>Away from work, I&rsquo;m a member of the Puget Sound Mycological Society. What does that mean? I hunt mushrooms. And for tracking down edible fungi has taken me into the remote wilderness of the pacific northwest.</p>
    <p>As an Anthropology major, I apply my knowledge of the social sciences to a range of clients in unexpected ways. As UX Director in my previous role, I developed methodologies and taught out the processess that helped grow a culture of UX literacy in an early stage startup. Now, I look forward to meeting entrepreneurial spirits who want to take on social problems through a user-centered design approach. <a href='/contact' title='Contact Trever'>Drop me a line</a> if that sounds like you.</p>
