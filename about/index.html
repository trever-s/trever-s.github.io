    <p class="heading">Hi, I&rsquo;m Trever.</p>
    <p>I’m a user experience designer who obsesses over typographic choices and responsive design. I became interested in UX to help people. Most recently as Director of UX at Iron Point. I worked remotely to complete projects in addition to managing and guiding small teams of talented, inexperienced front-end developers. </p>
    <p>Away from work, I’m a member of the Puget Sound Mycological Society and I volunteer for Friends of the Columbia Gorge maintaining wild areas on the river. My love for nature is something I document with my camera, along with my beautiful family and moths — such complex creatures (moths and my family).</p>
    <p>As an Anthropology major, I can apply UX thinking to a diversity of clients (corporations, startups and non-profits) in unexpected ways.  For instance, as UX Director I developed and promoted the documentation that fostered a culture of UX literacy.  I personally ran UX research on real and potential clients and promoted our product to those clients.  Now I look forward to applying this approach of user-centered design with public interest groups to serve a greater need.</p>
