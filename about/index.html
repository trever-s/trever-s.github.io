    <p class='heading'>Hi, I&rsquo;m Trever.</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m a designer with a background in front-end development and a knack for curious. I became an advocate for user-centered design while learning how to fold Web standards into my code almost a decade back.</p>
    <p>Currently, I&rsquo;m an interaction designer at Fjord. Some of our clients include T-Mobile, Microsoft, Costco, and the Seattle Mayor&rsquo;s office.</p>
    <p>Away from work, I&rsquo;m a member of the Puget Sound Mycological Society. Hunting mushrooms has taken me into some of the most remote wilderness in the Pacific Northwest. My experiences in the wild shaped me into an amateur naturalist, conservationist and activist.</p>
    <p>As an Anthropology major, I apply my knowledge of social science to a range of client work in unexpected ways. In my previous role as UX Director at Iron-Point, I devised and taught methodologies that helped foster a user-centered culture at an early stage startup. Nowadays, I look forward to meeting entrepreneurial spirits who want approach social change with user-centered design. <a href='/contact' title='Contact Trever'>Please drop me a line</a> if that sounds like you.</p>
