    <p class="heading">Hi, I&rsquo;m Trever.</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m a user experience designer, who codes and obsesses over typographic choices and responsive design.</p>
    <p>I love helping people. It&rsquo;s why I got into UX.</p>
    <p>My background in anthropology lets me apply UX thinking to corporations, startups and non-profits in unexpected ways.</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m a member of Puget Sound Mycological Society, and can point out fungi, shrub, bird and tree species on my favorite hikes in the Olympic and Cascade mountains.</p> 
    <p>I also volunteer for Friends of the Colubmia Gorge, where I help maintain wild areas on the river.</p>
    <p>My love for nature is something I document with my camera, along with my beautiful family and moths — such complex creatures (moths and my family).</p>
    <p>On the weekday, you can find me riding my bike to cafes in Seattle, where I've worked remotely as UX director for the past four years at Iron-Point. A small agency based out of Denver, Colorado.</p>
    <p>In the future, I&rsquo;m looking forward to working closely with like-minded people, more UX designers and an organization with a mission worth fighting for.</p>
