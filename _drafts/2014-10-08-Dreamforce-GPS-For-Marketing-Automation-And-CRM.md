Tough love and proper guidance are necessary in order to accomplish great things. Whether trying to create a company, grow revenue further, or simply increase brand awareness, without the right team in your corner substantial opportunities can be missed.

Knowing this, our onsite staff at Dreamforce will be offering complimentary 1-on-1 strategy sessions, tailored to your unique business needs, in order to help answer any questions on CRM and Marketing Automation.

Over the course of this week, we understand that there will be a lot of resources available to you, and deciding with whom to spend your valuable time can be a headache in itself. Our candor, along with decades of digital marketing expertise and the insight we offer on the marketing automation industry as a whole, are what set us apart from the competition. As a large number of platforms have been acquired or have gone public in the last year, many customers, partners, and potential clients have been left wondering where they stand. Knowing your options and realizing how the various platforms’ shifting of power will affect you are what we are here to help you with. The truth may hurt, but the easy route of putting a band-aid on underlying issues will only leave you with scars down the road.

We've been around the block a time or two, technologically speaking, and have seen various platforms excel, slowly fall apart, or worst of all, forget their customers altogether. Sitting in on sessions with heavy hitters in our industry will no doubt leave you informed and in awe of their offerings, but will you leave with a candid perspective of the issues unique to your business, and how to face them? We are certified (nerds) for a reason, and will provide solid guidance without any strings attached. In our industry, knowing the facts, being armed with a pro-active plan, and having a true partner that will tell it to you straight is the only way to set your company on the path to increasing conversions and revenue. 

Something we can’t answer? Part of being a true partner is pointing you in the right direction; if we truly don’t know how best to resolve an issue you are facing, we will happily put you in touch with our network of contacts better suited to help address your query.

Now that we’ve laid it on the table, if you are interested to see if your current situation is what’s truly best for you, we’re your go-to source at Dreamforce. Feeling like a consultant may be taking advantage of you? Your platform is lacking in capabilities? Let’s chat! I personally will be dedicating my time at Dreamforce this year to conducting and leading these strategic discussions, as I feel it’s that valuable and important for you to know there is help out there. Ready to schedule a time to chat now? Shoot me a message at <a href="mailto:info@iron-point.com" alt="Email Dan">info@iron-point.com</a>, or <a href="/contact-us/">contact us</a> and I will reach out to you shortly.
