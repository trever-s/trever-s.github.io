    <p class='heading'>Hi, I&rsquo;m Trever.</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m a user experience designer with a background in front-end development and visual design. I became interested in UX to help people. Most recently as a User Experience designer at Iron-Point. I worked remotely to complete projects in addition to managing and guiding talented, inexperienced teams.</p>
    <p>Away from work, I&rsquo;m a member of the Puget Sound Mycological Society and I volunteer for Friends of the Columbia Gorge maintaining wild areas on the river. My love for nature is something I document with my camera, along with my beautiful family and moths &mdash; such complex creatures (moths and my family).</p>
    <p>As an Anthropology major, I can apply UX thinking to a diversity of clients (corporations, startups and non-profits) in unexpected ways.  For instance, as UX Director I developed and promoted the documentation that fostered a culture of UX literacy. Now I look forward to applying this approach of user-centered design with public interest groups and non-profits to serve a greater need.</p>
